# KeyCloak

!!! warning
    While this could stand on its own as a standalone recipe, it's a component of the [sso-stack](/recipes/sso-stack/) "_uber-recipe_", and is written in the expectation that the entire SSO stack is being deployed.

![KeyCloak Screenshot](../images/keycloak.png)

## Ingredients

1. [Docker swarm cluster](/ha-docker-swarm/design/) with [persistent shared storage](/ha-docker-swarm/shared-storage-ceph.md)
2. [Traefik](/ha-docker-swarm/traefik_public) configured per design
3. DNS entry for the hostname you intend to use, pointed to your [keepalived](ha-docker-swarm/keepalived/) IP

## Preparation

### Setup data locations

We'll need several directories to bind-mount into our container for both runtime and backup data, so create them as follows

```
mkdir /var/data/runtime/keycloak/database
mkdir /var/data/keycloak/database-dump
```

### Prepare environment

Create /var/data/keycloak/keycloak.env, and populate with the following variables, customized for your own domain struction. Take care with LDAP_DOMAIN, this is core to the rest of the [sso-stack](/recipes/sso-stack/), and can't easily be changed later.
```
# Technically, this could be auto-detected, but we prefer to be prescriptive
DB_VENDOR=postgres
DB_DATABASE=keycloak
DB_ADDR=db
DB_USER=keycloak
DB_PASSWORD=myuberpassword
KEYCLOAK_USER=admin
KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD=ilovepasswords

# This is required to run keycloak behind traefik
PROXY_ADDRESS_FORWARDING=true

# What's our hostname?
KEYCLOAK_HOSTNAME=cloud.example.com

# Tell Postgress what user/password to create
POSTGRES_USER=keycloak
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=myuberpassword
```

Create /var/data/keycloak/keycloak-backup.env, and populate with the following, so that your database can be backed up to the filesystem, daily:

```
PGHOST=db
PGUSER=keycloak
PGPASSWORD=myuberpassword
BACKUP_NUM_KEEP=7
BACKUP_FREQUENCY=1d
```

### Setup Docker Swarm

Create a docker swarm config file in docker-compose syntax (v3), something like this:

!!! tip
        I share (_with my [patreon patrons](https://www.patreon.com/funkypenguin)_) a private "_premix_" git repository, which includes necessary docker-compose and env files for all published recipes. This means that patrons can launch any recipe with just a ```git pull``` and a ```docker stack deploy``` üëç
```

```

!!! note
    Setup unique static subnets for every stack you deploy. This avoids IP/gateway conflicts which can otherwise occur when you're creating/removing stacks a lot. See [my list](/reference/networks/) here.


## Serving

### Launch OpenLDAP stack

Launch the OpenLDAP stack by running ```docker stack deploy keycloak -c <path -to-docker-compose.yml>```

Log into your new instance at https://**YOUR-FQDN**, and login with the user/password you defined in keycloak.env.

You start in the "Master" realm - but mouseover the realm name, to a dropdown box allowing you add an new realm:

![KeyCloak Add Realm Screenshot](/images/sso-stack-keycloak-1.png)

Enter a name for your new realm, and click "_Create_":

![KeyCloak Add Realm Screenshot](/images/sso-stack-keycloak-2.png)

Once in the desired realm, click on **User Federation**, and click **Add Provider**. On the next page ("_Required Settings_"), set the following:

* **Edit Mode** : Writeable
* **Vendor** : Other
* **Connection URL** : ldap://openldap
* **Users DN** : ou=People,<your base DN>
* **Authentication Type** : simple
* **Bind DN** : cn=admin,<your base DN>
* **Bind Credential** : <your chosen admin password>

Save your changes, and then navigate back to "User Federation" > Your LDAP name > Mappers:

![KeyCloak Add Realm Screenshot](/images/sso-stack-keycloak-3.png)

For each of the following names, click the name, and set the "_Read Only_" flag to "_Off_" (_this enables 2-way sync between KeyCloak and OpenLD_AP)

* last name
* username
* email
* first name

Proceed to setting up [Email](/recipes/sso-stack/docker-mailserver/)...

## Chef's Notes

1. I wanted to be able to add multiple networks to KeyCloak (i.e., a dedicated overlay network for LDAP authentication), but the entrypoint used by the container produces an error when more than one network is configured. This could theoretically be corrected in future, with a PR.
