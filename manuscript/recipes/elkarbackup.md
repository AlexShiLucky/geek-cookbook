# Elkar Backup

ElkarBackup is a free open-source backup solution based on RSync/RSnapshot

![ElkarBackup Screenshot](../images/elkarbackup.png)

## Why is this a WIP?

!!! warning "Concerns re ongoing development"

    I have some concerns about the ongoing support of the project. The repo for the website was last committed **2 years ago**, and I've submitted a [PR](https://github.com/elkarbackup/elkarbackup.github.io/pull/2) for a blatant typo on the front page, which also shows up in the first google search result for "elkar backup".

    However, the code itself seems to be [updated frequently,](https://github.com/elkarbackup/elkarbackup/commits/master) the last update being 19 days ago.

What's missing from the recipe currently is:

1. An explanation for the environment variables, plus details re how to use scripts to send data offsite, like Duplicity does.
2. Details about ElkarBackup
3. A mysql container to backup the elkar database


## Details

## Ingredients

1. [Docker swarm cluster](/ha-docker-swarm/design/) with [persistent shared storage](/ha-docker-swarm/shared-storage-ceph.md)
2. [Traefik](/ha-docker-swarm/traefik_public) configured per design
3. DNS entry for the hostname you intend to use, pointed to your [keepalived](ha-docker-swarm/keepalived/) IP

## Preparation

### Setup data locations

We'll need several directories to bind-mount into our container, so create them in /var/data/elkarbackup:

```
mkdir -p /var/data/elkarbackup/{backups,uploads,sshkeys}
```

### Prepare environment

Create elkarbackup.env, and populate with the following variables
```
SYMFONY__DATABASE__PASSWORD=password
EB_CRON=enabled
TZ='Spain/Madrid'

#SMTP
#SYMFONY__MAILER__HOST=
#SYMFONY__MAILER__USER=
#SYMFONY__MAILER__PASSWORD=
#SYMFONY__MAILER__FROM=

# For mysql
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password

#oauth2_proxy
OAUTH2_PROXY_CLIENT_ID=
OAUTH2_PROXY_CLIENT_SECRET=
OAUTH2_PROXY_COOKIE_SECRET=
```

### Setup Docker Swarm

Create a docker swarm config file in docker-compose syntax (v3), something like this:

```

!!! note
    Setup unique static subnets for every stack you deploy. This avoids IP/gateway conflicts which can otherwise occur when you're creating/removing stacks a lot. See [my list](/reference/networks/) here.



## Serving

### Launch ElkarBackup stack

Launch the ElkarBackup stack by running ```docker stack deploy elkarbackup -c <path -to-docker-compose.yml>```

Log into your new instance at https://**YOUR-FQDN**, with user "root" and the password you specified in gitlab.env.

## Chef's Notes

1. If you wanted to expose the ElkarBackup UI directly, you could remove the oauth2_proxy from the design, and move the traefik_public-related labels directly to the app service. You'd also need to add the traefik_public network to the app service.
