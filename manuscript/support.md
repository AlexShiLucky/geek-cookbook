# Support

## Welcome to the kitchen

For community support and engagement, I've setup a [Discourse forum](https://discourse.geek-kitchen.funkypenguin.co.nz/). Using this as the primary means of discussions makes it easy to share recipes / experiences with future geeks.

## Discuss a recipe

Every recipe includes a section at the end for comments.

If you have a comment / question about a specific recipe, navigate to the recipe, scroll to the bottom, and add your comment. You'll be sent to the [kitchen](https://discourse.geek-kitchen.funkypenguin.co.nz/) to post the actual comment, but it'll be visible beneath the recipe _and_ at the kitchen. (_To post, you'll need to sign in using OAuth from github, google, etc, or create a new account_)

## Request a recipe

I'd love to hear your ideas for more recipes. To request/suggest a recipe, create a new post in the [kitchen](https://discourse.geek-kitchen.funkypenguin.co.nz/) with the details.

## Spit out a bug

Found a bug in your soup? Tell the chef by either:

1. Commenting on the recipe (see above), or
2. Submitting an issue against the github [repo](https://github.com/funkypenguin/geek-cookbook/issues)

## Tip the chef

### Buy my book üìñ

I'm also writing the cookbook as a formal book, on Leanpub (https://leanpub.com/geeks-cookbook). Buy it for $0.99 (_which is really just a token gesture of support_) - you can get it for free (_in PDF, mobi, or epub format_), or pay me what you think it's worth!
