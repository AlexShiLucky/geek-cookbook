# RTorrent / ruTorrent

![Rtorrent Screenshot](../../images/rtorrent.png)

When using a torrent client from behind NAT (_which swarm, by nature, is_), you typically need to set a static port for inbound torrent communications. In the example below, I've set the port to 36258. You'll need to configure /var/data/autopirate/rtorrent/rtorrent/rtorrent.rc with the equivalent port.

## Inclusion into AutoPirate

To include NZBGet in your [AutoPirate](/recipies/autopirate/start/) stack, include the following in your autopirate.yml stack definition file:

## Chef's Notes

1. In many cases, tools will integrate with each other. I.e., Radarr needs to talk to SABnzbd and NZBHydra, Ombi needs to talk to Radarr, etc. Since each tool runs within the stack under its own name, just refer to each tool by name (i.e. "radarr"), and docker swarm will resolve the name to the appropriate container. You can identify the tool-specific port by looking at the docker-compose service definition.
