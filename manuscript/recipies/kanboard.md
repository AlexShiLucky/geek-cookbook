* Limit your work in progress to be more efficient
* Customize your boards according to your business activities
* Multiple projects with the ability to drag and drop tasks
* Reports and analytics

## Ingredients

1. [Docker swarm cluster](/ha-docker-swarm/design/) with [persistent shared storage](/ha-docker-swarm/shared-storage-ceph.md)
2. [Traefik](/ha-docker-swarm/traefik) configured per design
3. DNS entry pointing your NextCloud url (_kanboard.example.com_) to your [keepalived](ha-docker-swarm/keepalived/) IP


## Preparation

### Setup data locations

Create the location for the bind-mount of the application data, so that it's persistent:

```
mkdir -p /var/data/kanboard
```


### Setup Docker Swarm

Create a docker swarm config file in docker-compose syntax (v3), something like this:

!!! tip
        I share (_with my [patreon patrons](https://www.patreon.com/funkypenguin)_) a private "_premix_" git repository, which includes necessary docker-compose and env files for all published recipes. This means that patrons can launch any recipe with just a ```git pull``` and a ```docker stack deploy``` üëç

## Serving

### Launch Kanboard stack

Launch the Kanboard stack by running ```docker stack deploy kanboard -c <path -to-docker-compose.yml>```

Log into your new instance at https://**YOUR-FQDN**. Default credentials are admin/admin, after which you can change (under 'profile') and add more users.

## Chef's Notes

1. The default theme can be significantly improved by applying the [ThemePlus](https://github.com/phsteffen/kanboard-themeplus) plugin.
2. Kanboard becomes more useful when you integrate in/outbound email with [MailGun](https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-mailgun), [SendGrid](https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-sendgrid), or [Postmark](https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-postmark).
