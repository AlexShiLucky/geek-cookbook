The "private cloud" platform is:

* **Highly-available** (can tolerate the failure of a single component)
* **Scalable** (can add resource or capacity as required)
* **Portable** (run it on your garage server today, run it in AWS tomorrow)
* **Secure** (access protected with LetsEncrypt certificates)
* **Automated** (requires minimal care and feeding)
